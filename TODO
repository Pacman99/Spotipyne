devices should be selectable
start/stop spotifyd with a button

better handling for selecting playlist, while another is still loading
add search
add functionality to heart button
add All songs to Library
Rename "Playlists" to "Library"
add Spotify created playlists
Add More controls on clicking on the simple controls panel
Add playlist description above Playlistracks

Future (first get real features done):
find out why app is still unreactive while loading a playlist

fix some covers aren't found (probably because of markets / actually no. I don't know)

error when spotify auth failed

do spotify auth via interface
