currently:
this is a mess right now. I think I should have a subclass of the GenericSpotifyRow, that can build another Widget, that should then be pushed onto the current contentDeck (that push-function has to be passed through)
and then there has to be another subclass, that just does normal function calls, like start playing a song or something.
And I really don't like how Saved Tracks are handled right now. Maybe I could have two Lists above each other looking like one? Or maybe just split up Library and Playlists again like spotify-tui does. Idk.

start/stop spotifyd with a button

limit threads, that are started when loading a playlist
better handling for selecting playlist, while another is still loading // I guess this is kind of done
re-add playing songs in playlists
add more searchresults option
Fix episodes don't get displayed in simpleControls panel
add functionality to heart button
add All songs to Library
the playlist pages need a random play button.
add Spotify created playlists
Add More controls on clicking on the simple controls panel

Future (first get real features done):
fix some covers aren't found (probably because of markets / actually no. I don't know)
